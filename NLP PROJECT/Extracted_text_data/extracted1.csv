complexity, integration points, and ongoing cost of operations; and reduce customization wherever
possible by modifying workflow in order to fit out-of-the-box or configured solutions. This will enhance
NYSERDA’s ability to calibrate and adapt its technology layer to best support its evolving
programmatic and policy goals.
